        United States Naval Aviator LT Pete "Maverick" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) LTJG Nick 
        "Goose" Bradshaw are stationed aboard the USS Enterprise, from which they fly the F-14A Tomcat. During an 
        interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by USN F-5s), Maverick gets missile-lock on one, 
        while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the 
        remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the 
        carrier. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. CAG "Stinger" sends 
        Maverick and Goose to attend TOPGUN, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar.
